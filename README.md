CastleBuilder is my solution to the first problem.
It is intended to be exported and run as a JAR file.
It only excepts a single String as a program arguement. This String should be a comma seperated list of integer values.
The output of this program is the number of castles that can be built.
I assumed that no castle can built on the 5's in the given input "1,5,5,5,7".

TransformerBattle is my solution to the second problem.
It is intended to be exported and run as a JAR file.
It only excepts an array of Strings as program arguements. These Strings should be in the following format:
"name,team,strength,intelligence,speed,endurance,rank,courage,firepower,skill"
Each transformer must be it's own index in the String array.
I assumed that when a tie occurs that the surriving bots from both teams should be printed.
